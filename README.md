# The Thinking Cloth Chronicle
Version 2 of the thinking cloth chronicle website. Version 1 used streamlit but their community cloud sending websites to sleep after a day of inactivity means it isn't the best option anymore

Version 1 site url: https://thethinkingclothchronicle.streamlit.app

Version 1 repo url: https://github.com/LockNation/newsletter-site.git



## TODO:
Version 2 should at minimum contain all the functionality of version 1.
- ~Get a domain~
- ~Find a place to host it~
- Write the html
- Add CSS
- Add JS if needed
